	Cubes(From Left to Right):
		Cube1: This cube was the goal of the second part of the lab and its color interpolates between 
		       two input colors, in this case aquamarine and perano. This was set up in the shader 
		       created during the tutorial.
		Cube2: This cube was the result of first part of the lab and is a grey/white cube that is 
		       repetively highlighted by a green gleam due a specular reflection set to 0x00ff00.
		Cube3: This was the first personally created cube for the first part of the lab that required
		       a new unique cube to be added. Unlike the previous cube, this cube is white and radiates
		       red color through the emissitvity color being set to red. Though the cube's color is 
		       is white, it will constantly appear red, besides the side closest to the user.
		Cube4: The 4th cube, the result of the final portion of part two, acts in similar ways to the 
		       first cube. This cube interpolates between white and red, making the effect of the 
		       shader more clear to the naked eye. The final cube is also making use of its wireframe
		       form, making the cube invisible besides its edges. With this effect, the red appears
		       to chase the corner in which moves closet to the user. This was set up by the usage of
		       a second fragment shader.
